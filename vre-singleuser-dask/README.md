This image deployed on the [jhub-vre.cern.ch](jhub-vre.cern.ch) allows multiple users to spawn multiple dask clusters by creating a scheduler each time a user asks for it, following the logic o fthe [Dask Gateway](https://gateway.dask.org/). The image is accessible by selecting the environments with 'DASK' in the description at notebooks' start up. 
If you decide to select this image, you can run a notebook and check that you can spawn a cluster by running:

```
import dask
import dask.distributed
from dask_gateway import Gateway
from dask_gateway import GatewayCluster
import dask.array as da
import requests
from dask_gateway import scheduler_preload
import os
```

To check the service of the `dask-gateway` is reachable, run:

```
requests.get("http://traefik-dask-dask-gateway/api/health").content
```

And then connect to the Gateway:

```
gateway = Gateway(address="http://traefik-dask-dask-gateway/",
    auth="jupyterhub")
gateway.list_clusters()
cluster = gateway.new_cluster()
cluster.scale(4)  # to create 4 worker nodes
```

You will see the scheduler and the worker pods appearing in the k8s cluster under the `jhub` namespace.
